### Part 2: Generation command

There are several command lines available to generate an SDK depending on the use cases.\
These cases are covered in the [documentation](https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/otter/tree/main/packages/%40ama-sdk/schematics) of the package `@ama-sdk/schematics`.

#### Objective

Generate a new SDK repository using the previous specification file and the provided command line.

#### Exercise

To generate a new SDK repository, you can run the following command line:

```bash
yarn create @ama-sdk typescript training-sdk
```

You will receive a prompt asking you to specify the project name.\
For example, you can set the project name to `training-project`.

```bash
? Project name (NPM package scope, package.json name will be @{projectName}/{packageName})? training-project
```
